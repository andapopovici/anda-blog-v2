I'd like to write more on this blog, but most of the time I need to come up with ideas. As I struggle to do that, I want to have a list of potential topics that I can refer back to.

I'll group topics by effort, and I can pick one depending on how much time I want to spend on something.

## Potential topics:

### Quick

- an article I've read with some commentary/what I learned
- something I’ve learned - short post on a single smaller thing I learned 

### Not so quick

- something I’ve learned - more in depth (e.g. a course I've done, larger topic I've learned about)
- a project I was involved in recently
- my experience as ...
- a process or tool I'm passionate about - this could go in either category depending on what's involved
