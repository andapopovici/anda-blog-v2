Keeping up to date with news from the front-end, design & accessibility world can be overwhelming. Instead of looking for articles to read every week, I subscribe to a few newsletters. I also use an RSS reader for specific people I follow, but that's maybe a different post.

Here's the newsletters I get every week:

## Accessibility Weekly

[Accessibility Weekly](https://a11yweekly.com/) is a fantastic way to keep up with accessibility news. I always find a few gems in there every week. We regularly use content from here to spark conversations in our fortnightly Accessibility Forum at work. It's well curated and quite popular, so I would definitely recommend this one to keep up to date with accessibility things. Some articles are more in depth than others, so it's a good source of bookmarks for later reading. You could start right now by checking out [their archive](https://a11yweekly.com/issues/).

## Friday front-end

As the name suggest, [Friday front-end](https://fridayfrontend.curated.co/) comes out on a Friday and lists 5 front-end related articles for the week. I really appreciate that it's limited to 5 items so I don't get overwhelmed by the amount of content. It's got a mix of CSS, accessibility and Javascript topics and I think it's a great way to keep up with new things especially in CSS.

## Smashing Newsletter

The [Smashing Newsletter from Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/) can be a good source of (mostly) short articles and other resources. I find this one a mixed bag because they do a theme each week and some topics are more interesting than others to me. However, as usual, Smashing Mag are doing a great job so there will be something in there that will catch your eye. It's also a good way of keeping up with their events, new books or workshops.

## Pixels of the Week

[Pixels of the Week from designer St√©phanie Walter](http://stephaniewalter.design/subscribe-to-the-blog-updates/) is a design and accessibility focussed newsletter. She's a big accessibility advocate so I really appreciate her applying that lens to all her work and articles she shares. There's also usually some "off topic" articles which I appreciate.
